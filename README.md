# DIPLOMA-GAN-PUBLIC

## Description

This repository contains the project for my undergraduate degree. It leverages a clone of Hill Climb Racing, originally created by Code Bullet, to teach Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate 2D levels. These levels are then used to train AI agents, providing a practical application of machine learning techniques in game development.

## Features

- **Generative Adversarial Network (GAN):** The GAN consists of a generator and a discriminator, working together to create and refine 2D levels.
- **Node.js Server:** A Node.js server is implemented to generate and edit levels using Python scripts, in which the trained generator is utilized. The server also collects statistical data from the game.

## Setup

1. **Game Files:** Place the game files into XAMPP to be able to run them.
2. **Node Server:** Run the Node.js server from the `ground-json-generator/index.js` file.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hill-climb-racing-ai-level-generator.git](https://github.com/SwindleBreeze/DIPLOMA-GAN-PUBLIC.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd DIPLOMA-GAN-PUBLIC/ground-json-generator
   ```
3. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Copy files from game-files folder to your xampp htdocs

## Usage

1. Start the Node.js server:
   ```bash
   node ground-json-generator/index.js
   ```
